### Expected App Behaviour

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state

### Caveat

**⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️: When you create the live version of your project, we recommmend giving it a random name for the URL. This is because with it being a fake credit card form, some browsers will open a warning notice before people can access your project. So it's best to name the project something unrelated to credit cards so that browsers don't show the warning to people viewing your project.**
